# PrivacyRaven

**PrivacyRaven** is a privacy testing library for deep learning systems. You can use it to determine the susceptibility of a model to different privacy attacks, evaluate privacy preserving machine learning techniques, develop novel privacy metrics and attacks, and repurpose attacks for data provenance and other use cases.
